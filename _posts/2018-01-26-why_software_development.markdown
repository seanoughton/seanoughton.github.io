I like technology and I like stories. 

I used to be a Video Editor, which was a great way to combine those two things.  

I found myself working on videos about Technology.  These were stories of how people were using these technologies to make the world a better place. I was really inspired not only by the accomplishments of the these people, but also their passion.  

Here are few of the videos I worked on:

So now my passions are shifting, from wanting to tell stories about technology, to wanting to be a character in the story of technology.  

And I see a lot of similarities between storytelling and coding.

In story telling you build a framework made out of a plot and then fill it with characters that do things to advance that plot.  These characters have inherit traits that cause them to interact with each other, advancing the plot forward.  Iâ€™m new at programming, however, it seems like in coding you use a framework ( a programming language) and create objects(characters) with that ability to do things and interact with each other.  

Similarly, methods are like scenes or chapters in a story.  Both methods and scenes have their own scope and their own function.  A scene in a film/video needs to have a beginning and an end, a main focus and a story arc.  When creating a scene, you only use the elements necessary to complete the scene and move the story forward.  Methods seem very similar to me.


Both storytelling and programming use abstraction .  An object that you create in Ruby, has a timeline as does a character in a story.  Both objects and characters are born and life events happen to them. Both coding and story telling allow you to step into certain moments in the timeline of their objects .. their characters. 


In a larger sense, It seems to me that technology and story telling are both providing a similar function in people's lives ... connection. Stories allow people to bond over plot and characters. Technology can allow people to connect and interact through social platforms.  They both allow people to connect with each other in new and meaningful ways.  Through that connection, the individuals gain a greater understanding of themselves, and a greater sense of community. 

I hope to be part of the story that technology is creating.  By working on projects that help to connect people, so that they can better understand each other, and better understand themselves.
