My Rails Portfolio Project is a Cookie and Wine Pairing application.

### Description

Users share their Cookie and Wine Pairings with the platform, by creating pairings with existing Cookies and Wines, or by adding their own Cookies and Wines.  Users can rate and comment on pairings.  Also the app will let Users know where they can buy the Wines or find recipes for the cookies.

### What I learned

I learned a lot by through the process of creating this application.  

One of the most important things that I learned and what I will use the most going forward, is planning to use DRY code from the start and thinking about how to write helper methods and active record methods that can be reused.  Planning out the overall flow of the application and how the data will be modeled is really important before starting to flesh out the application and code.  Knowing in advance that you will need methods to find models and attributes of models and writing those methods in advance, saves a lot of time at the end when trying to DRY up the code.  Knowing what kind of data is going to be needed for the application to function and how to get that data in and out of the database is key to keeping your code DRY from the beginning.  

Also starting small, by just doing CRUD on one type of model, helps you to figure out what type of CRUD will be needed for other models.   

Another thing I learned, was that no matter how frustrated or lost you become, knowing that you will always be able to find your way out and get a working solution is very calming.

Specifically, I really feel like a learned a lot about how and why nested resources are there.  How they help to get the proper data in the params and how they help to format that data so that you can easily perform CRUD operations on your models.

### Conclusions

In conclusion, I feel like this project really tested my knowledge of Rails, Ruby and SQL.  I am excited to move forward and see how Ruby and Rails integrates with Javascript.
